    <p>Specificity Calculator isn't a CSS validator. If you enter invalid selectors it will return incorrect results. For example, the negation pseudo-class may only take a simple selector as an argument. Using a pseudo-element or combinator as an argument for :not() is invalid CSS3 so Specificity Calculator will return incorrect results.</p>
    <p>Coming out of the top were two flat metal poles. At the top of these poles there was a screen - like a tablet but bigger.</p>
